# Printing Hello World

With the understanding of how to input data into the stacks one may wonder, how would you output this data. This page will do its best to not answer this question any meaningful way unless you just care about printing "Hello World". This is so you can flex on all your friends by saying you only had to write three characters to output hello world.

## Character

To output "Hello World" you just put down the "|" character. There are absolutely no changes done to your stacks.

## Examples

With each example will come the state of both stacks at each turn using the following format along with the program output. The "top" of the stack is the rightmost character as shown below.

Turn: 0  
LetNum Stack: 2, 1  
Operation Stack: +, -
Program Output:

In this example "b" would be at the top of the LetNum Stack and "-" would be at the top of the operation stack.

### Example 1

```
2  ....

Operation Stack:  
Program Output:  

Turn: 1  
LetNum Stack:  
Operation Stack:  
Program Output: Hello World

Turn: 2  
LetNum Stack: b  
Operation Stack:
