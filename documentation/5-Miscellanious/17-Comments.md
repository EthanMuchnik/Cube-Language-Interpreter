# Comments

Another feature that makes cube a revolutionary language is that it has an innovative way to put in comments. Since the cube interpreter only looks at what's inside the cube fold out, you can write whatever you want outside and there won't be any issues. 

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
2  ....
   .  . Cube 
   .);. is 
.......... better 
.( .v .2 . than 
.  .b .1 . C
..........
   .>a.
   .  .
   ....
   .  .
   .  .
   ....
```

### Example 2:

```
2  .... Mountain
   .v<. Dew
   . ". is
.......... the 
.  .= .  . superior
.  .1".  . beverage
..........
   .;*.
   .)8.
   ....
   . 9.
   .(^.
   ....
```

## Conlusion

If you actually read this entire documentation and took the time out of your life to learn this language that has few real-life uses other than promoting the consumption of mountain dew and the side effects that come along with it, I have two things to say to you.

1. Thank you very much. You are on your way to becoming one of the first full-stack cube developers.
2. What in the world are you doing with your life? Do you even value your time? You realize that this language is a meme right?

Just kidding about the second point. I really appreciate that you went on this journey with me and please recommend this language to people that you think would want to explore it and have a couple hours to throw away. Also keep tabs on my GitHub account "EthanMuchnik" for any future projects!

Have a dewyriffic day!
